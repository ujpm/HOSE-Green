**[HOSE Green](https://ujpm.github.io/HOSE-Green/)** was inspired by the urgent need for collective action against environmental degradation. Witnessing the alarming statistics of deforestation, pollution, and climate change, I realized that while awareness is growing, the gap between knowledge and action remains vast. Our mission is to empower individuals and communities to take meaningful steps toward sustainability, transforming concern into action.
